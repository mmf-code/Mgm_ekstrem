üå¶Ô∏èüå°Ô∏è My Personal Internship Project: Analyzing and Visualizing Extreme Temperatures on Map

During my internship at the Turkish State Meteorological Service 2nd Regional Directorate, I had the opportunity to work on a personal project that focused on analyzing and visualizing extreme temperatures in the region during the summer season. The primary goal was to compare the estimated temperatures with the region's extreme heat and create a user-friendly tool for meteorologists.

I developed a Python program that automatically compared the daily temperature predictions for the next 5 days, extracted from the meteorologist's data in an Excel file, with the region's extreme temperature value. This program effectively processed the data, eliminating the need for constant updates or manual modifications.

To enhance the interpretability of the results, I went beyond simple comparison algorithms. Instead, the program provided a visually appealing representation of the temperature data on a map. By using distinctive color schemes for extreme, near-extreme, and non-extreme temperature ranges, meteorologists could easily grasp the information at a glance.

Ensuring the accuracy of the data was crucial for reliable forecasts. To address this, I implemented data validation checks within the program. Any incorrect values detected during the comparison process triggered alerts for users, reducing the likelihood of misinformation.

One of the project's challenges was the variation in region names across three different data files, including differences in Turkish and English characters. However, I successfully incorporated a code that automatically reconciled these disparities during the comparison process. As a result, manual intervention for verification purposes was kept to a minimum.

The outcomes of this project are highly valuable for the Meteorology Directorate's preparedness efforts in dealing with extreme weather conditions. By providing a clear visual representation of temperature forecasts and identifying areas experiencing extreme temperatures, meteorology staff can make more informed decisions and plan effectively.

I am immensely grateful to the Meteorology 2nd Regional Directorate for granting me the opportunity to work on this project during my internship. This experience has not only expanded my technical skills in Python programming but also deepened my understanding of meteorological data analysis and visualization.
